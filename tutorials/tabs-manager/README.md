Pin your extension to the toolbar from the puzzle menu to quickly access your extension during development. 
When you click on the extensionâ€™s icon, you should see the popup html.

## Reloading the extension

1. After saving certain files, you also have to refresh the extension. Go to the Extensions page and click the refresh icon next to the **on/off** toggle:
